<h1>Locus errans</h1>
<h2>Plānities Planētēn<sup><a href="#nota1-abajo" id="nota1-arriba"></a></sup></h2>
  <p>
A threshold-dweller introduces himself asymptotically towards the interior of the ample exterior. He walks on a bioluminescent plain, up to the ultralimen of his perception of the retinal horizon, potentially, where occurs a cyclic, orboid and orbital purple terminus. <i>Orbit</i>, it occurs to him to coin, so that it resembles <i>Orphic</i>. Although without <i>extranatural</i> assumptions. In any case, as that ancient one said, “such knowledge would be as useless as it would be to know the chemical composition of the solar wind for the navigator in danger of shipwreck”. Besides, the catabatic as cathartic.
</p>
<p>
Catharsis was done by the ancestral flowers. Now their descendants perfume, and shoot petals with audacity, which then rain slowly. In phanerogamous plurality, the plain sweetens turgescently everywhere, manifesting its regular irregularity, after genetic ingenuities. As another ancient one said: “let thousands of flowers bloom”. As in that inclination on a hillock, towards a parvis, towards a vista threshold, whether of the neighbouring valley, neighbouring continent, neighboring stellar system: virtual idempotence. A cognitively galvanizing astral aroma is light shimmering mist on the violaceous ground. His footsteps, semi-hidden, simultaneously raise wafts of consciousness during the pathfinding of his wandering.
</p>
<h2>Adversus Montem<sup><a href="#nota2-abajo" id="nota2-arriba"></a></sup></h2>
<p>
 The wanderer reaches a flux of light sprouting from a rock on the ground, proceeding at an ophthalmic height, until reaching nearby hills. Said liquid branch was already precursorily, <i>in medias res</i>, when the anthropes installed the atmogenic dome visible in a distant mountain range. The former an old but functional machine with its anti-obsolescence programming since the epoch of the explorers, designed to synthesize, and not to fail; rather something exceeded itself. In the orogenic topological coursing, the ludic one trots up the slope, elevating himself towards an arboreal transhumance. There, maieutic fruits of invigourating lares nourish semi-nomads, visitors, as one of them says, “of a spa never the same, always torrential”.
</p>
<p>
The stony torrent leads to a crag where deliberately is a sword, which artefact is indeed now obsolete, except sportively. And certain morphological changes contrast with neural focuses and their associations, like productions of concepts, and of lenses to see in chaos. In another semiology, a marble sculpture and an isometric hologram, juxtaposed, both with an arm gesturing towards the La Tène-like longsword.
</p>
<h2>Kēpeuma Kharítōn<sup><a href="#nota3-abajo" id="nota3-arriba"></a></sup></h2>
<p>
Eventually, partially surrounded by a gigantic tree, whose canopy is lost in high darkness, in the middle of a forest clearing, in possible sensory evolution, some studiers move. They drink sap and experiment with arboreal diapasons. Cosmonautic epicuroids syndicate to build doors whose required wood is not cut, but grown, and for their eventual maintenance in neo-historical proto-acts. Mnemosyne's eyes alternate between squinting and protuberating. Clio intones polyphonies. Lugos Tricephalus manifests <i>roncón</i>, <i>ronqueta</i> and <i>ronquillo</i>. The third face pauses momentarily to indicate that “the first one produces the basso continuo”.
</p>
<p>
Continuing among mushrooms of warm light and luminous warmth, “which feels like at 14 hertz”, says someone sitting on one of them, the threshold-dweller's feet turn lighter, more agile, Hermetic, and his eyes too, hermeneutic. Thenthere he cognizes the local spacetime that will be his suprafertile peripatetic garden, his perpetual threshold, while his neurons neuronates, his heart heartates, his air aerates. The one which will continue orbiting fruitfully, until when the magnetic fields, when his autopoietic subcellular fluxes, can no longer postpone that entropy do him part.

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul class="notes">
	<li id="nota1-abajo"><a href="#nota1-arriba"></a><i>Plānities</i> ‘plains’; πλανήτην <i>planḗtēn</i> ‘errant’. The origin of <i>planet</i> is <i>planēta</i>, (-<i>tes</i>), the Latin adaptation of Greek πλανήτης <i>planḗtēs</i> ‘errant’. What we now know as “planets” was observed in antiquity as errant stars (<i>stellae errantes</i>).</li>

      	<p>For consulations on Classical Latin and Ancient Greek, I refer to the dictionaries of the <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper">Perseus Digital Library</a>, a website managed by Tufts University (Massachusetts, USA). For Latin, specifically, I also refer to the dictionaries available at <a href="https://latinitium.com">Latinitum</a> (the sources of which include Perseus Digital Library), a website created and managed by Daniel Pettersson and Amelia Rosengren. For my notes I translate the results of whatever the case may be, as the dictionaries are in English. I also abbreviate or add clarifications, as may be convenient.
